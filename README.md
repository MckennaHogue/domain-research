,`*DOMAIN QUESTIONNAIRE*`,

1. List 10 available domains (use http://iwantmyname.com) you think would be appropriate for your site:

  1.  http://Spearfishinggame.com
  2.  http://Spearfishgame.com
  3.  http://Spearthefish.com
  4.  http://Thegameoffish.com

  7.  http://Spearfishingisfun.com
  8.  http://Spearfishingfun.com
  9.  http://Swimmingfish.com
  10. http://swimmingspearingfish.com
  
2. What type or genre of domain is this? (Ex. Game, Toy, Greeting Card Generator, Creative Tool, Political Pamphlet, Archive)
 
  This domain will be a game. Maybe even a never ending game, I havent decided yet!
  
3. Write a small story (one paragraph or so) that details a user's experience of discovering your domain, visiting it within a particular context (like mobile, desktop, while hungry, at a funeral, etc.), experiencing what it has to offer, and subsequently leaving.

  Rick had just gotten back from his first spearfishing trip with Ryan. 
  He was so stoked and decided to get some of his own gear online. Rick
  took a bite out of his chipotle burrito and started searching the web
  for what the best guns and dive suits were. He came across some blogs 
  that told him about different places to spearfish and when the different
  seasons were. He got fired up and new this would be his new favorite hobby. 
  While searching the web he came across my spearfishing game. He thought
  the game was awesome and fun to play. He also thought it was cool you could
  pick out different guns and suits to use in the game.
  
4. Would somebody return to your domain after visiting it for the first time - in how long do you think - and why?

  Yes I think someone would return if they liked the game! I dont think it will
  be a super entertaining game or a game you are determined to play a lot in one
  sitting like Snake, but someone would return to it if they were bored or into 
  spearfishing!  
  
5. List some 'stuff' that your site 'does'. (Be detailed)

  1. You can aim your gun and shoot the fish.
  2. You can then grab the fish you have speared and put it in your kill bag.
  3. You must be carful that a seal doesn't come by and steal your kill bag. So you can 
  move your player up and down, not forwards and backwards.
  4. When a shark passes through the player will pee his or her pants. 
  5. Also player can choose which camo suit and gun they would like to play with.
